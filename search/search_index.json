These behavior can be preconfigured by IT admins so that the users don't need to do it themselves. There are two ways to preconfigure seafile client: On windows, the admin can store the details it in the windows registry. On all desktop platforms (win/linux/mac), the admin can also store the details in a file seafile.ini in the HOME folder of the user. Preconfigure options for sync clients \u00b6 Using Windows Registry \u00b6 The preconfigure information can be stored in one of the following two places: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Seafile or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Seafile If the information is found in both places, the one under HKEY_CURRENT_USER would take precedence. Special Note for 64bit Windows Deployment If you are using 64-bit windows and using HKLM instead of HKCU to deploy your seafile program. please note you need to correct the PrimaryKey to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Wow6432Node\\\\Seafile instead of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Seafile . This is because seafile client is compiled as a 32-bit application on windows. List of Available Preconfigure Options.

It supports Windows 10 1709 version (2017 Fall Update for Windows 10) and later versions. We recommend Windows 10 users to upgrade to SeaDrive 2.0 for more native virtual drive experience. SeaDrive 2.0 is currently in Beta status. We'll mark it stable after we have more user feedbacks. Install and Access the Virtual Drive \u00b6 You can download SeaDrive 2.0 from official Seafile website . After installation and logging into your Seafile account, SeaDrive will start downloading library and file lists from the server (just as in SeaDrive 1.0.x). It may take some time, depending on the number of files available in your seafile account. The download is progressive, so in the mean time you can already access some files in the virtual drive. To access the virtual drive, just open Windows file explorer. There is a \"seadrive\" node in the navigation pane of Windows file explorer. Accessing Files in the Virtual Drive \u00b6 Libraries are grouped into 4 categories in the virtual drive: My Libraries, Shared with me, Shared with groups and Shared with all. As you can see, the file status icons is more integrated into Windows file explorer. The icons are a bit different form version 1.0. Files in the virtual are created as \"placeholders\" in the local file system. They may be in 3 states: Placeholder file : An empty representation of the file and can only be opened when there is network connection. Full file : The file has been downloaded and saved locally. Download is automatic when a placeholder file is opened for the first time. These files are available whenever you open SeaDrive regardless to network connections. The operating system may decide to clear a full file when more disk space is needed. Pinned full file : The file has been downloaded and saved locally. It is guaranteed to be available offline. You can control which files or folder are cached locally. This can be changed from the context menu when you right click on a file or folder. Choose \"Always keep on this device\" when you want to pin a file or folder locally; choose \"Free up space\" when you want to clean the cache for a file or folder. In SeaDrive 1.0, cached files are not automatically updated when they're updated on the server. In SeaDrive 2.0, full and pinned files are automatically kept in sync with the server. File Download and Control \u00b6 Whenever you open a placeholder file, the operating system will automatically start to download it. If the file may take some time to download, there will be a progress bar shown up in file explorer and you may cancel the download. Sometimes a background application may try to download a file in the virtual drive (such as an Anti-Virus software). You will be notified by the operating system about this and you may choose to cancel the download or disallow the application from automatically downloading files in the future. Frequently Asked Questions \u00b6 Can I create, delete, rename libraries? \u00b6 Yes. When you create, delete or rename library folders in the virtual drive, the operation will be reflected on the server. You can only create, delete, rename libraries under the \"My Libraries\" category. Creating, deleting or renaming libraries in other categories will be ignored. Can I create files or folders outside of a library folder? \u00b6 Yes. But files created outside of a library folder will be ignored and NOT synced to the server. A new folder under the \"My Libraries\" folder will be handled as a new library. Can I access encrypted libraries? \u00b6 Yes. By default, encrypted libraries are not synced and shown in the virtual drive. You need to manually choose which encrypted libraries to sync and enter the password. Just right click on the SeaDrive icon in the system tray area and choose \"Show encrypted libraries\". A windows will show up and you can choose to sync or unsync an encrypted library. Is it compatible to SeaDrive 1.0? \u00b6 SeaDrive 2.0 will use any existing accounts and their metadata (stored under C:\\users\\username\\seadrive\\ folder). But it will not use the cached files from SeaDrive 1.0. So any locally cached files in 1.0 version will not be accessible in 2.0 version. You can start SeaDrive 1.0 again to upload the files to server or copy them out. How do I clean the cache? \u00b6 You can manually choose which folders or files to be cached locally. If you find a folder consumes too much space, just choose to \"Free up space\" on that folder and all cached files in that folder will be cleaned. There is no need to set cache cleaning time and cache size limit as in SeaDrive 1.0. Because placeholders are just normal files created on your local disk, your cache size is only limited by the available disk space on your computer. How to remove left-over SeaDrive shortcuts in Windows Explorer? \u00b6 The \"SeaDrive\" shortcut in Windows Explorer won't disappear after you exit SeaDrive progrme or switch Seafile accounts in SeaDrive. This is an intended behavior. You don't need to remove them if you still need to access the account later. In some corner cases, the \"SeaDrvie\" shortcut will be left-over in Windows Explorer and you want to remove it. You can usually remove those shortcuts by uninstalling SeaDrive program. If uninstallation doesn't remove the shortcuts successfully, you can remove the SeaDrive shortcut in Windows Explorer by editing the registry. Open the path \"HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Desktop\\NameSpace\\\" in registry editor. Remove the sub-keys correspond to the shortcut you want to remove.","title":"Using drive client 2.0 on Windows"},{"location":"drive_client/drive_client_2.0_for_windows_10/#seadrive-20-for-windows-10","text":"SeaDrive 2.0 (and future versions) is redesigned with deeper integration to Windows 10 operating system.

After logging into your server, the virtual drive will be mounted in ~/SeaDrive. Running SeaDrive without GUI \u00b6 In some use cases, it is useful to run SeaDrive in a server environment. To use SeaDrive without GUI, you can directly run seadrive-daemon (the background daemon) from command line. First, you have to obtain an access token from your server. curl - d \"username=username@example.com\" - d \"password=123456\" https : // seafile . example . com / api2 / auth - token / Then you have to prepare a config file for SeaDrive. Let's assume that you save the config file as ~/seadrive.conf. [account] server = https://seafile.example.com username = username@example.com token = 3131a3a93156f80bc86aa9f12cf794e0364ed57b is_pro = true [general] client_name = johns-ubuntu [cache] size_limit = 10GB clean_cache_interval = 10 You can only specify one account in the config file. If you need to switch accounts, you'll have to stop SeaDrive, change config file and restart. Meaning of config options are as following: token: The access token you obtained above. is_pro: Set to true if your server is Pro edition. client_name: This name will be displayed in the device information on the server. size_limit: Size limit of local cache space. clean_cache_interval: Interval of cache cleaning. The unit is minute. Then you can start seadrive: seadrive -c ~/seadrive.conf -f -d data-directory [-l logfile] virtual-drive-dir Note that you must give -f option in the command line, to make sure seadrive runs in foregound, instead of forking as a daemon.

There are usually two common use cases for file management in these organizations: There should be a common file sharing space for the organization. The folder hierarchy should map the department hierarchy. There will be separate folder or space assigned to each department. The sharing space should be owned and managed by the organization, but not individual employees. So that the ownership of files doesn't have to be changed when an employee leaves the organization. Before version 6.3.0, files in Seafile can only be owned by individual users and shared to other users or groups. In 6.3.0, we introduce the \"Departments\" feature to meet the above two use cases. This new feature works side by side with the existing sharing features. We'll introduce this feature from 3 different perspectives: System admin Department admin Department members System Admin \u00b6 The system admin can: Manage department hierarchy and members Assign storage quota for departments Create and manage shared libraries in departments Manage department hierarchy and members \u00b6 The system admin can setup the department hierarchy in two ways: manual setup or import from Active Directory. The system admin can create any number of top level departments and create any levels of sub-departments under each department. And each level of department can be populated with members. The system admin can set the role of each member to 'member' or 'admin'. We'll introduce how can a department admin manage department later. The system admin can also import the hierarchy from OUs (Organizational Units) in AD. Please refer to \"Sync OU to departments\" section in LDAP Group Sync documentation . Each OU will be imported as a department. And the sub-OUs under an OU will be imported as sub-departments. Department libraries can be automatically created in the import process. System admin can also delete a department after all the sub-departments and libraries are deleted. Assign Storage quota for departments \u00b6 The file libraries created inside a department are owned by the department itself, not by any individual user. So the system admin can assign storage quota to a department. The total size of all the libraries in a department cannot exceed the storage quota. Please note that the quota of sub-department doesn't depend on the quota of its parent department. Create and Manage shared libraries in departments \u00b6 Unlike groups, libraries owned by individual users cannot be shared to a department. Department libraries can only be created by the system admin or department admin. This is for the purpose for more consolidated control of the libraries. All the above operations can be done in the system admin interface. See the below screenshot for information. Department Admin \u00b6 As noted above, department admin is a special role assigned by the system admin to some members of a department. Department admins can perform the following operations in a department after login to his/her own account. Access to the libraries of the department Manage members in his/her department Manage libraries in his/her department For the end users, a department can be accessed as a special type of group. Each department is presented to its members as a group. A user can not only access to the libraries in the department he/she belongs to, but also the libraries in the parent departments of his/her department. For example, if John is in the \"EMEA\" sub-department under the \"Sales\" department, and \"Sales\" is a sub-department under the company \"ACME\", John can then access to the groups \"EMEA\", \"Sales\" and \"ACME\". The groups for departments are marked with a \"building\" icon next to its name. See the screenshot below for details. If a user is the admin of a department, he/she can add or delete members in the department. Any users registered in the system can be added as member of the department. But if the departments are imported from AD, the changes to membership will be overwritten on the next sync with AD. Department admin can manage the libraries in the department. The supported operations are: Create or delete library Change library name Share a library to users or groups outside of this department. This is very useful for cross-department collaboration. Set fine-grained permission to folders in the libraries for users or sub-departments in this department. This works like the folder permission feature . Department Members \u00b6 A normal member of the department can use the department just like a group. Each department is presented to its members as a group. A user can not only access to the libraries in the department he/she belongs to, but also the libraries in the parent departments of his/her department. For example, if John is in the \"EMEA\" sub-department under the \"Sales\" department, and \"Sales\" is a sub-department under the company \"ACME\", John can then access to the groups \"EMEA\", \"Sales\" and \"ACME\". The groups for departments are marked with a \"building\" icon next to its name. The only difference from groups is that, libraries owned by a user cannot be shared to a department group.","title":"Departments Sharing"},{"location":"sharing_collaboration/departments/#managing-and-using-departments","text":"Some organizations consist of complex department hierarchy. There are usually two common use cases for file management in these organizations: There should be a common file sharing space for the organization. The folder hierarchy should map the department hierarchy. There will be separate folder or space assigned to each department. The sharing space should be owned and managed by the organization, but not individual employees. So that the ownership of files doesn't have to be changed when an employee leaves the organization. Before version 6.3.0, files in Seafile can only be owned by individual users and shared to other users or groups. In 6.3.0, we introduce the \"Departments\" feature to meet the above two use cases.

The system admin can also import the hierarchy from OUs (Organizational Units) in AD. Please refer to \"Sync OU to departments\" section in LDAP Group Sync documentation . Each OU will be imported as a department. And the sub-OUs under an OU will be imported as sub-departments. Department libraries can be automatically created in the import process.

Seafile handles this situation nicely with conflict files. But it's often more convenient to lock the file when one person wants to exclusively modify the file. Seafile Professional Edition supports file locking. File locking works on both the web app and the desktop syncing client. We'll introduce them one by one. File Locking on the Web App \u00b6 To lock a file, you can navigate into the file's folder on the web app, and click on the \"operations\" drop-down menu. After the file is locked, you can see a red \"stop sign\" at the corner of the file icon. Moving the mouse on the stop sign, you can see who locks the file. And you can also unlock a file that's locked by you. But you cannot unlock files locked by others. File Locking on the Desktop Client \u00b6 After a library is synced to the desktop, you can lock/unlock files in that library inside File Explorer on Windows or Finder on Mac OS. To lock a file, just right click on a synced file and choose \"lock this file\" in the \"Seafile\" menu. If a file is locked by you, you can see an orange \"stop sign\" on the file icon. You can choose to unlock it. If a file is locked by other user, you can see a red \"stop sign\" on the file icon. The file is automatically set to read-only. You cannot modify it until it's unlocked. If a library is not synced, you can still use cloud file browser to lock and unlock files in it. Auto Locking Office Files \u00b6 After a library is synced to the desktop, when you open a Microsoft Office file inside the library, Seafile automatically locks the file. When you close the file, Seafile automatically unlocks the file. The locking state is propagated to other computers syncing this library. It prevents concurrent editing the same Office file and is convenient for collaboration. Details about File Locking \u00b6 There are a few useful tips about how file locking works: A locked file can only be unlocked by the user who locked it. A locked file cannot be modified, moved, renamed or deleted by other users. But other users can still move, delete or rename the parent folder of a locked file. The purpose of file locking is mainly to prevent concurrent editing. When a locked file's parent folder is renamed or moved inside the same library, it remains locked after the operation.","title":"Locking files"},{"location":"sharing_collaboration/file_locking/#file-locking","text":"When more than one person collaborate on a file, it's likely that more than one person modify the file at about the same time.

Available permissions are the same as the ones described in sharing libraries . Here are some use cases: You shared a library to a group with \"read only\" permission. You also want to allow a specific member of the group to modify files in one sub-folder. You can grant write permission of this sub-folder to this person. You shared a library to 3 groups. There are 3 sub-folders under that library, one for each group to upload files. However you don't want users to change files not belong to his/her group. You can grant write permission of a sub-folder only to its group. Folder permissions are only effective for libraries and folders you share to others. To effectively set folder permissions to its sub-folders, you should first share the parent library or folder; otherwise the folder permission won't take effect. One important design goal of folder permission is to support hierarchical permissions: Sub-folders automatically inherit folder permissions from its parent folder. Permissions set on sub-folders overwrites permissions set on its parent folder. For example, you set \"read write\" permission on folder \"meeting files\" for user A, and you set \"read only\" permission on sub-folder \"meeting files/today\" for user A. Then user A's permission to \"meeting files/today\" is \"read only\". Basic Usage \u00b6 Only library's owner can set folder permissions for its sub-folders. In the file browsing interface, click \"more operations\" button, choose \"permission\" in the drop-down menu. In the pop-up window, you can see and set folder permissions on this folder. If you want to see all folder permissions set in a library, hover the mouse on the library. Click \"more operations\" button, choose \"Folder Permission\" in the drop-down menu. In the pop-up window, you can see and set folder permissions in this library. When other users navigate into a folder, there will be a small \"eye\" icon next to \"read only\" sub-folders. When the user navigate into that sub-folder, he/she won't be able to add/modify/delete files. If a \"read only\" folder is synced to PC with the Seafile desktop App, changes under a \"read only\" folder won't be uploaded to the cloud. Advanced: Priority between Different Permissions \u00b6 Folder permissions have higher priority than the permission set in share. For example, if you shared a library to user A with \"read write\" permission, and also set \"read only\" permission to a sub-folder of that library. Then user A only has \"read only\" access to the sub-folder, while he/she has \"read write\" access to all other sub-folders and files. Folder permissions set to specific user have higher priority than permissions set to a group. That is, when checking permission for a folder, if the system matches a permission specific to the user, it'll ignore all permissions set for the groups the user belongs to. Permissions on sub-folders have higher priority than those on parent folders. Here is a more complex example: Supposed the folder structure looks like \"A/B\", User \"John\" is in group \"Staff\". If you set \"read only\" permission on folder A for John, and, you also set \"read write\" permission on folder \"A/B\" for group \"Staff\". Then John's permission to folder \"A/B\" is still only \"read only\". That's because, according to rule 2, \"read only\" permission is first matched for folder \"A/B\" and user \"John\", which is inherited from it's parent \"A\".","title":"Folder permission"},{"location":"sharing_collaboration/folder_permission/#use-folder-permission-for-fine-grained-access-control","text":"For shared libraries or folders, you can set permission to its sub-folders for a person or a group.

To achieve this, create a seafile-ignore.txt file in the root folder of a library. This special file specifies the files and folders that Seafile should not sync. Each line in a ignore.txt file specifies a pattern. The following pattern format are supported. A blank line matches no files. A line starting with # serves as a comment. Seafile supports wildcards in the pattern. For example, \"foo/*\" matches \"foo/1\" and \"foo/hello\". \"foo/?\" matches \"foo/1\" but not \"foo/hello\". Note that the wildcard character * recursively matches all the paths under a folder. For instance, \"foo/*.html\" matches \"foo/a.html\" and \"foo/templates/b.html\". If the pattern ends with a slash, it would only match a folder. In other words, \"foo/\" will match a folder \"foo\" and paths underneath it, but will not match a regular file or a symbolic link \"foo\". If a pattern doesn't end with a slash or a wildcard, it would not match a folder. For example, \"foo\" can only match regular file \"foo\" or a symbolic link; while \"foo/\" and \"foo*\" match a folder and paths under it.

If you want to run multiple instances of Seafile cli client in the same machine, you can specify different config-dir and parent-dir when initializing different client instances. Then the instances can run without interfering each others. When starting the instances, just specify ccnet config directories with the -c option. start \u00b6 Start seafile client.

Since Seafile implements wikis as standard Seafile libraries, they can be synced and shared with other users just like any ordinary library. Column View \u00b6 Wikis usually have a side bar containing a tree-like folder structure, to enable quick-and-easy browsing of Wiki pages. Seafile's Column View allows you to manage the files in a library in the same way as a Wiki space. Users can browse in it and move files and folders just by dragging and dropping.
